    <p> Before you can begin to determine what the composition of a particular
        paragraph will be, you must first decide on an argument and a working
        thesis statement for your paper. What is the most important idea that you
        are trying to convey to your reader? The information in each paragraph
        must be related to that idea. In other words, your paragraphs should
        remind your reader that there is a recurrent relationship between your
        thesis and the information in each paragraph. A working thesis functions
        like a seed from which your paper, and your ideas, will grow. The whole
        process is an organic oneâ€”a natural progression from a seed to a
        full-blown paper where there are direct, familial relationships between
        all of the ideas in the paper.</p>
