      A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that
      forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not
      determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in
      some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can
      be just one sentence long.
