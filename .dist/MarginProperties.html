      Before you can begin to determine what the composition of a particular
      paragraph will be, you must first decide on an argument and a working
      thesis statement for your paper. What is the most important idea that you
      are trying to convey to your reader? The information in each paragraph
      must be related to that idea. In other words, your paragraphs should
      remind your reader that there is a recurrent relationship between your
      thesis and the information in each paragraph. A working thesis functions
      like a seed from which your paper, and your ideas, will grow. The whole
      process is an organic one—a natural progression from a seed to a
      full-blown paper where there are direct, familial relationships between
      all of the ideas in the paper.
