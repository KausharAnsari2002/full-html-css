    <p> Before you can begin to determine what the composition of a particular
        paragraph will be, you must first decide on an argument and a working</p>
        <br/>

       <p>thesis statement for your paper. What is the most important idea that you
        are trying to convey to your reader? The information in each paragraph</p>

       <p> must be related to that idea. In other words, your paragraphs should
        remind your reader that there is a recurrent relationship between your</p>
        <br/>

       <p> thesis and the information in each paragraph. A working thesis functions
        like a seed from which your paper, and your ideas, will grow. The whole
        process is an organic oneâ€”a natural progression from a seed to a
        full-blown paper where there are direct, familial relationships between
        all of the ideas in the paper.</p>
