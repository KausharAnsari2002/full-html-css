      ough most paragraphs should have a topic sentence, there are a few
      situations when a paragraph might not need a topic sentence. For example,
      you might be able to omit a topic sentence in a paragraph that narrates a
      series of events, if a paragraph continues developing an idea that you
      introduced (with a topic sentence) in the previous paragraph, or if all
      the sentences and details in a paragraph clearly refer—perhaps
      indirectly—to a main point. The vast majority of your paragraphs, however,
      should have a topic sentence
