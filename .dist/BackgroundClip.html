      A well-organized paragraph supports or develops a single controlling idea,
      which is expressed in a sentence called the topic sentence. A topic
      sentence has several important functions: it substantiates or supports an
      essay’s thesis statement; it unifies the content of a paragraph and
      directs the order of the sentences; and it advises the reader of the
      subject to be discussed and how the paragraph will discuss it. Readers
      generally look to the first few sentences in a paragraph to determine the
      subject and perspective of the paragraph. That’s why it’s often best to
      put the topic sentence at the very beginning of the paragraph. In some
      cases, however, it’s more effective to rder of the sentences; and it advises the reader of the
      subject to be discussed and how the paragraph will discuss it. Readers
      generally look to the first few sentences in a paragraph to determine the
      subject more effective to place another sentence before the
      topic sentence—for example, a sentence linking the current paragraph to
      the previous one, or one providing background information
