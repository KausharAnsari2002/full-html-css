   <p style="color: green; background-color: tan;"> Before you can begin to determine what the composition of a particular
    paragraph will be, you must first decide on an argument and a working
    thesis statement for your paper. What is the most important idea that you
    are trying to convey to your reader? The information in each paragraph
    must be related to that idea. In other words, your paragraphs should
    remind your reader that there is a recurrent relationship between your
    thesis and the information in each paragraph. A working thesis functions
    like a seed from which your paper, and your ideas, will grow. The whole
    process is an organic one—a natural progression from a seed to a
    full-blown paper where there are direct, familial relationships between
    all of the ideas in the paper.</p>
