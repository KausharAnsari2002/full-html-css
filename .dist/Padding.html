        Before you can begin to determine what the composition of a particular
        paragraph will be, you must first decide on an argument and a working
        thesis statement for your paper. What is the most important idea that
        you are trying to convey to your reader? The information in each
        paragraph must be related to that idea. In other words, your paragraphs
        should remind your reader that there is a recurrent relationship between
        your thesis and the information in each paragraph. A working thesis
        functions like a seed from which your paper, and your ideas, will grow.
        The whole process is an organic one—a natural progression from a seed to
        a full-blown paper where there are direct, familial relationships
        between all of the ideas in the paper. Before you can begin to determine
